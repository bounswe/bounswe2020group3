## Environment Variables

You must create a file "`.env`" and set REACT_APP_API_URL to the correct value, our back-end url. 
## Before Running
You must run `npm install` in the project to install all packages that are needed, from `package.json`. 
Without this, the project will not run. 

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console. If you have es-lint


### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
