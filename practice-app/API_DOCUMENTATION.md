In a single session you'll learn about real risks, assailant tricks, crucial targets and how to create an impact, and releases from the most common grabs. You will learn about how to recognize when someone is looking at you like a victim, and how to prevent attack -- but, if attacked, how to fight back and escape. Joanne Factor has been teaching safety and self-defense for over 19 years. As owner and instructor at Strategic Living Personal Safety and Self-Defense Training, she's taught ages 5 to 75, students and sorority sisters, homeless women and business executives, and everyone in between. She is also a volunteer advocate for DAWN, an agency in South King County providing services to domestic violence survivors. Joanne's expertise has been featured on KIRO Channel 7 TV, Q13's Washington's Most Wanted, KUOW 94.9 FM, and The Seattle Times Magazine. Originally from Brooklyn, New York, Joanne holds a BA from Cornell University, a black belt in karate, and was named Seattle's Best Feminist Butt-Kicker in 2007 by the Seattle Weekly. She is author of the forthcoming book Self-Defense 101: What Every Woman Absolutely, Positively Needs to Know for Her Own Safety. Please read our privacy, refund/rescheduling, and financial assistance policies before registering (https://www.StrategicLiving.org/privacy.php). www.StrategicLiving.org/privacy.php\n\nThank you for registering for Self-Defense Seminar for Women on Sunday, May 15. We will begin at 1:00 and end by 6:00 pm. Location is 1426 South Jackson Street, 3rd floor, Seattle WA 98144 (studio of the Feminist Karate Union). You can get directions via Google Maps, and even see a photo of the front of the building. (https://www.google.com/maps/place/1426+S+Jackson+St,+Seattle,+WA+98144/@47.5995118,-122.3149525,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x54906ac00ad8a149:0x837cd9ae00984812) Wear comfortable workout-style clothing. Because the floor is matted, we ask that no outdoor shoes be worn in the training space (bare feet or socks are fine). Bring water (or other preferred beverage) and a snack or light lunch. If you could print out and sign the Class Participation Agreement (found at this link http://www.strategicliving.org/downloads/ClassParticipAgmt.pdf) and bring it with you, that would be awesome and help ensure we start on time. Each participant should have her own form, and a parent does need to sign for anyone under the age of 18. If you cant print the form, I will have some on hand. At the beginning of class I will ask you to introduce yourselves (first name only OK), share one major concern you'd addressed in this class, and tell us how you found this particular class (my website, from a friend, the Seattle Times article, etc.). Thanks to all of you who already noted your specific concerns when registering online, that is very helpful. If there are any topics you'd like to ensure we cover, please email me. My cellphone, in case you need directions or are running late, is 206-920-8882. Please note, though, that I will be turning my phone's ringer off when class begins. I look forward to working with you on Sunday!
